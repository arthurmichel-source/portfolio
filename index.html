<div style="margin-top: 20px; margin-left: -275px; margin-right: 450px">The fourth dimension, put simply, is the space in between the limitations of the three dimensions we exist in. We aren’t able to physically interact with the fourth dimension, but the outstretch of our imaginations are not dictated or limited by physics. For example, you are able to visualize the inside of an orange but unless you peel it you aren’t able to interact with whatever lies beyond the peel... ja feel?
 Einstein theorized that time was the fourth dimension. Due to the fact this is theory, as an artist I am able to conceive the fourth dimension as a space where the unknown forms and exists. I use my emotions as the variable that affects our lives in a similar way to time. Just like clock is an artistic representation of time, I am attempting to map and visualize emotions in the same way through my artistic practice. 
Through reasoning and objectifying my human experiences and behaviors I am able to convert mental records into recognizable forms. I do this to present my work as a means of creating dialogue between myself and the viewer. The connection between the viewer and the piece is a fourth dimensional experience. I am using the fourth dimension as a point of reference to visually describe the experience of thinking and feeling and where it comes from.
